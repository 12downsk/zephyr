# openvr-notifications

Mirror Android notifications to OpenVR.

Build using these technologies:

 * Android
 * C++
 * Electron
 * NodeJS
 * Qt
 * SocketIO
 
## Disclaimer
This project, for now, is a quick hack. Things work, but aren't polished.
I will have minimal (if any) access to a Windows development environment 
and an OpenVR HMD for the next couple of months, so certain updates 
(especially relating to the overlay) will be few and far between.

*More documentation coming soon...*
